# Madbox's Game Developer test

**The time it took you to perform the exercise**
* It's been 10h approximately.

**The parts that were difficult for you and why**
* The only part I had a bit of trouble with was with the 1 finger joystick input. It was my first time working with this kind of input, and I didn't know what would be the best way to develop it. After some research I finally found good examples that, after understanding them, they helped me find a good implementation for this feature.

**The parts you think you could do better and how**
* I think that I could try more different ways to detect the collision between the player's weapon and the enemies, so I can choose the best option. 

**What you would do if you could go a step further on this game**
* There are a lot of things like the remaining bonus features: weapon drop, menus, music and sounds. Also, I could add more attack behaviours, bonus pickables (health, shield), a ton of VFX, etc. However, the thing I'd like to do most now is adding a mini-map in the HUD, I've never developed a similar feature and I have an idea that could look cool and be really helpful.
